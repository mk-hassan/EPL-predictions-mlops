EPL FEATURE SELECTION - QUICK REFERENCE
=====================================

RECOMMENDED FEATURE SET (7 features):
1. home_goals_conceded_last_n ★
2. away_goals_scored_last_n ★
3. home_goals_scored_last_n ★
4. away_goals_conceded_last_n
5. h2h_away_wins
6. h2h_home_wins
7. whh_away_avg

★ = Consensus features (all 5 methods agree)

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
• 19 features analyzed
• 3 consensus features identified
• 6 high correlation pairs avoided
• 5 selection methods used: F-test, Mutual Info, Chi2, Random Forest, RFE

NEXT STEPS:
1. Use feature_recommendations['balanced'] for model training
2. Validate performance with cross-validation
3. Consider feature_recommendations['minimal'] for simpler models
4. Deploy with confidence - analysis complete!
